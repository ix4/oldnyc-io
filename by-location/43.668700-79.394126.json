Harris to widen Avenue Rd. between Queen's Park Cres. and Bloor St. to a width of 54 feet, would destroy the two rows of elm trees shown ABOVE. In all there are over 50 large trees which grace the northern approach to Queen's Park. The proposal to widen the thoroughfare was approved last week by the works committee, but their decision was rescinded when objection was raised by Parks Commissioner Charles Chambers. He urged the widening to a width of 36 feet, thus saving the trees. The present roadway is 28 feet wide.
